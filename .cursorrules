## PROJECT STANDARDS
### 1. Critical Rules
1. All functions must have docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.  
2. All commits must adhere to the Git commit conventions:  
   - Format: `[Keyword] Commit Message`  
   - Keywords: Feat, Fix, Refactor, Test, Chore, Style, Docs, Build, CI, Init  
3. The project must adhere to FastAPI's best practices for route and service separation.  
4. Environment variables must be stored securely in a `.env` file and excluded from Git.  
5. All data models should use Pydantic for validation and serialization.  
6. Testing must achieve at least 80% code coverage, focusing on critical routes and services.  
7. Service-layer code should be free from direct database or API interactions; use repositories or helpers.  
8. Data uploaded to AWS S3 must use proper access control policies to ensure security.  
9. All dependencies must be listed in `requirements.txt` with specific versions.  

### 2. Development Practices
1. Database models must use clear and descriptive field names.  
2. Follow RESTful standards when designing APIs, ensuring proper status codes and error handling.  
3. All uploaded files must be validated for size and type before processing.  
4. Logs should include timestamps, log levels, and detailed error information for debugging.  
5. Separate logic for handling external APIs (e.g., TTS and OCR) into distinct service modules.  
6. Ensure all changes are reviewed and approved through PRs before merging into `dev` or `main`.  
7. Use mock data and dependency injection during testing to isolate functionality.
